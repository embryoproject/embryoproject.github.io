            The first thing we did was run our baseline version with a single worker node (n=1) and proceeded
            to test different batch sizes to determine which size was fastest on a single node. We then used
            this batch size going forward as we scaled the cluster. As you can see in Table 1, batch size of 32
            performed the best.

            <br/>In Table 2 we provide explanations of the different parameter communication schemes we tested. Both methods
            are asynchronous ("async") meaning that a worker does not wait for the others to be done before proceeding.
            Each worker simply requests the latest parameters from the parameter server and proceeds. The important
            distinction is between "batch" and "epoch". Batch indicates that the frequency of the parameter updates
            occurs on each batch of data, whereas epoch indicates that the parameter updates happen only every epoch
            (an epoch is just a sequence of batches). As such, the computation to communication ratio is much higher
            in the latter "epoch-async" method, while the communication is much more dominant in "batch-async".

            <br/>We ran all our experiments with 1 master node and n=1,2,4,8,15 worker nodes (we could not increase any
            further due to a restriction of 16 total instances from AWS). To see the command-line arguments we used
            with spark-submit we invite you to read <a href="https://github.com/filip-michalsky/cs205_spring19_final_project#memory-issues">this.</a>

            </br>We see that in epoch-async mode our application achieves very good (superlinear) scaling, surpassing the
            ideal speedup (likely because Spark with n=1 induces large overhead compared to an optimized sequential code,
            which we did not run). We see that batch-async, however, performs very poorly with n>2.
            <br/><br/>

            We believe this is a result of growing communication overhead. Investigation into the CPU utilization of
            the worker nodes shows that only ~50% (of 400%) of each worker is being utilized for training. Meanwhile,
            when n>2, the communication server seems to be bottlenecked. We achieve roughly the same ~65-70% accuracy
            in all experiments.
