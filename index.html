              Overview:
              <b>
              While Assisted Reproduction Technology (ART) currently is responsible for 1.7% of babies born in the United States, selecting which embryo to implant is a significant challenge. Because of this difficulty, ART multiple pregnancy rates are nearly 20%, resulting in significant morbidity and medical expenses to patients. Here, we propose to create a software pipeline to improve embryo selection in ART. To this end, we will build novel deep learning and interactive data visualization approaches for clinical ART images. We will first extract and analyze visual biomarkers from routinely collected images of embryos. Then combining these visual biomarkers with patientsâ€™ electronic health record (EHR) data and clinical genetic testing of embryos, we will develop interpretable computation models to score embryos on their viability. We plan to integrate our software solutions into an open-source cloud service platform, easily accessible, and adaptable across clinics to improve ART embryo selection and clinical data analysis. This will also provide a novel opportunity to gain fundamental insight into the earliest stages of human development.
              Keywords: Assisted Reproduction Technology, clinical embryology, deep learning, data visualization.

              <br>
              To advance the field of ART with data-driven approaches, our proposed three-year project will first provide the community a large-scale public benchmark dataset, including annotated embryo images and associated anonymized EHR data, to encourage reproducible open research. With our novel computational models and visualization frameworks, biologists will be able to extract and analyze embryo features to deepen the pre- implantation understanding. Our extensible open-source cloud service platform, EmbryoProfiler, will be deployed to help facilitate daily operation in clinics, foster decision making, and enrich data-driven embryo analysis. Throughout, our project aims to discover novel biological insights, improve the success rate of ART, and build an open source community to share data and tools.

              Broader Impacts:<b>
              Our project will create state-of-the-art analysis approaches for ART clinicians around the world, possibly including ART in veterinary care. We expect that the general techniques and software we develop will be a useful template for other biomedical fields where images are combined with patient data, e.g., combining histology of cancer tumor biopsies with patient medical histories. We will tightly integrate education into the proposed program, by training postdoctoral scholars and graduate students, and by involving undergraduate and high-school students in this work. Outreach in particular to under-represented minorities and women at the undergraduate level will be accomplished through extensive and established mechanisms of the Harvard REU program.
