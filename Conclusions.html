          <b>Challenges:</b>
          <br/>Our primary challenge was getting the various software dependencies to work well with each other:
          <br/>- The installation of Elephas uses a version of PySpark which is incompatible with Scala on the EMR,
          and we had to manually install a compatible version.
          <br/>- To be able to launch AMIs on EMR, the AMI must be created from a compatible Amazon Linux EC2 instance.
          It took much trial and error to properly provision the AMI and EMR.
          <br/>- The amount of data is very large and mounting it on HDFS took very long, so we instead used a 30GB
          subset as an example, and left it to future work to expand to the full 1.5TB. Additionally, TFRecords is not
          natively supported on Spark and we had to install Apache Maven and a Tensorflow-Spark connector.
          <br/><br/>

          <b>Overheads:</b>
          <br/>The main overhead was the communication of parameters from worker nodes to master node.
          Secondary to this was the launching of the Spark application across the cluster, which plays a small role in runtime.
          <br/><br/>

          <b>Conclusions:</b>
          <br/>Big Data Machine Learning poses many additional challenges not encountered in traditional-scale ML such
          as I/O and serial compute bottleneck as well as memory and cache management when handling large datasets. We
          have tackled many of the distributed machine learning challenges in this project. We deployed an elastic
          Hadoop YARN cluster with Spark to achieve efficient scaling and lower execution time while maintaining similar
          accuracy.
          <br/><br/>

          <b>Future Work:</b>
          <br/>The primary area for improvement we suggest is to reduce the communication overhead by more efficiently
          communicating model parameters. Currently we run a Flask server on the master node, but many other methods
          such as MPI ring-AllReduce have been proposed [see Ref 4]. Further improvements include adjustment of the
          Elephas package to include multi-level model inputs allowing us to train a bi-LSTM with frame-level pixel
          and audio features. Additionally, to achieve higher accuracy, it will be helpful to utilize more feature
          channels and the full version (1.5TB) of this dataset.
